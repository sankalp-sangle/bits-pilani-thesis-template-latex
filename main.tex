\begin{abstract}
    Data Centers have emerged as the basic unit for providing web services to customers by major technology companies.
    They house servers in the thousands and tens of thousands, with servers often serving as backups to ensure reliability.
    The reliability of data center network infrastructure is critically important for ensuring seamless user experience.
    The nature and distribution of faults in data center networks isn't completely understood, and many faults like 
    microbursts due to fan-in traffic go undetected. A closer look is needed at the type of faults that occur in data center networks
     and on how they can be diagnosed.    
    Modern data centres operate at throughputs of close to a few hundreds of Gbps, implying packets coming in at a few hundreds of nanoseconds
    apart. Most monitoring solutions offer resolution of the order of milliseconds, and hence are inadequate
    for recording and detection of events that last for sub millisecond intervals.
    This thesis aims to discuss techniques for diagnosing faults in data centers, develop a monitoring system to view them, 
    at nanosecond raesolution. It is also demonstrated that appropriate calculations can be performed on the SQL queries
    to extract quantities like ingress throughputs, egress throughputs, relative ratios of packets in a network, (all at nanosecond
    resolution) thereby demonstrating that collecting relational data about switches is a simple and yet powerful way to extract meaningful 
    data and create relevant visualizations\cite{grafana} which can help a network administrator determine the root cause of faults in the network 
    and address them.

\begin{acknowledgements}
    This thesis has been written in a period when the world is at a standstill due to the threat of 
    COVID-19. As such, it has been a difficult but deeply enriching experience in Singapore, and it would
    be ungrateful of me to not give people their due acknowledgements.
    \\
    I am grateful to my supervisor, Dr. Mun Choon Chan, and co-supervisor Dr. Virendra S Shekhawat
    for their guidance and availability during the period of my thesis. I am also thankful for the
    guidance provided by Ph.D. candidates Pravein Govindan Kannan and Nishant Budhdev, and for their gracious nature and helpfulness in addressing all my doubts and making me feel comfortable in a foreign place. The
    numerous Zoom calls with Professor Chan, Pravein and Nishant were a beautiful learning
    experience for me. I am indebted to my roommate turned friend Yashdeep Thorat for having been a source of comfort,
    motivation, and stability when things turned difficult to bear. I am grateful to my family for their constant support, for being able to fall back on them, and for always being a phone call away.
    \\
    I am thankful to Singapore for having proven to be a place where I felt comfortable and at ease right from the first day. The culture and warmth of Singaporeans was a delight to observe and experience
    and I hope to one day, when it is safe again, return to Singapore and relive some of my experiences.
    \\
    Finally, I might not have taken the leap and tried to 
    apply for such an opportunity had it not been for the timely intervention and push by Miloni, and for that I am indebted to her\ldots
