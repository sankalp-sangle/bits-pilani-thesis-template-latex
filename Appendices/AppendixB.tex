Grafana is a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization software available since 2014. It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources. It is expandable through a plug-in system. End users can create complex monitoring dashboards using interactive query builders.

As a visualization tool, Grafana is a popular component in monitoring stacks, often used in combination with time series databases such as Prometheus and Graphite; monitoring platforms such as Sensu, Icinga, Zabbix, Netdata, and PRTG; SIEMs such as Elasticsearch and Splunk; and other data sources.
