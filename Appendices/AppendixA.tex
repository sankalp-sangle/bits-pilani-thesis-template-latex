Description on the Jain's Fairness Index

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{J}\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)=\frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}\right)^{2}}{n \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2}}=\frac{\overline{\mathbf{x}}^{2}}{\overline{\mathbf{x}^{2}}}=\frac{1}{1+\widehat{c_{\mathrm{v}}^{2}}}
    \end{equation}

    Raj Jain's equation rates the fairness of a set of values where there are n users, each having an associated
    throughput value. This metric ranges from 1/n in the worst case to 1 in the best case.
    \newline
    In this thesis, the metric is normalized to a scale of 0 to 1 before comparing it to thresholds as mentioned in
    the thesis sections.
